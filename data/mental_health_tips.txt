Looking after your mental health: a guide for young people

This guidance was produced together with the MHF Young Leaders. Together with Leaders Unlocked, The MHF Young Leaders are a diverse group of young people with a wealth of general life and specific mental health experiences who are helping to shape our work with families, children and young people.

Focus on the things you enjoy
This could be an existing hobby or something brand new that you wanted to have a go at. Try creating things (e.g. drawing, painting, writing, crafting), playing games or puzzles, decorating, or spending time watching or creating content on social media or streaming sites.

---

Set limits on the news and social media
While it is good to stay informed, media coverage of world and UK events can also be overwhelming and make us anxious and worried. Experiment to find the balance of news and media coverage that works for you. YoungMinds has information on how to have a more positive experience online.

- Try setting limits on how much media you watch, only going to a limited number of reliable places for news, sorting out your social media feeds to prioritise content that makes you feel good, and limiting content that makes you feel anxious or down, for example by muting particular people or hashtags.
- Check out screen time features available on your smartphone or the Some Good News YouTube channel.

---

Connect with others
Find time regularly to connect with friends, family, classmates, co-workers or others. It can help you all feel more connected.

- Try different ways of keeping in touch to find the ones that work best (e.g. video calls, quizzes or games with friends).
- If you use video calls for work or study, you might want to try something else for socialising: an online watch party where you all stream the same film and chat together, for example, or simply a phone call.

---

Find your routine
Try to find a routine that is realistic, flexible, and includes some fun. There are many ways to do this, so experiment with what works best for you. The proper routine for you might look different from someone else’s, and that’s okay!

- Try picking three things to do daily, breaking your day into chunks, or planning regular mealtimes and bedtimes.
- Find the things you like and turn them into your hobbies. “I’ve started sewing, drawing and coding my LED strip lights.” (Reflection from one of our Young Leaders)

Move your body
If we’re unable to exercise in the ways we prefer, we may not be as active as we usually would – which is important for our mental health. Try to include movement and activity in your routine in whatever way works best for you.

- Try an exercise that you already do, a new type of exercise, a stretch on the sofa, working out with a friend over video chat, or dancing around your room!
- Check out the range of different free exercise programmes on YouTube or different fitness apps like interval timers or yoga classes.

Treat yourself (and others) with compassion
Be as understanding of yourself as you are to a friend, especially if you’re finding things difficult or your plans have had to change.

Being compassionate towards others, and helping them if you’re able, can make you both feel good. Remember that we all may struggle in different ways, and being compassionate towards others can go a long way.

If you’re living with an existing mental health problem
Make sure you're in contact with your therapist or other mental health professionals by phone, video call or email.

Many organisations offer practical tips for managing your mental health, including:

- Every Mind Matters
- Anxiety UK
- OCD UK
- BEAT (eating disorders)
- Bipolar UK

There are also helplines and chatrooms such as The Sanctuary, Papyrus, CALM and Samaritans.

Reflections from our Young Leaders:
- “Limit your intake of news (whatever format it takes). Being inundated with constant negative news and updates on death will only increase anxiety and fear over a situation that is beyond your control.”
- “One important thing is to have one person that I FaceTime once a day to have someone outside the family to vent to.”
- “We have to do all our schoolwork but without the social aspect of having friends around, and it can be effective.”
- “Focus on what you can control… If you’re meant to be going to Uni and that’s up in the air, put it aside and look at what else you could be doing for the interim before carrying on that path again.”
- “Take it a day at a time, some days will be easier to stick to a routine than others. Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t as productive as you’d like to be. Your productivity is not tied to your identity.”

For students and school leavers

Being at school, college or university can bring particular worries or challenges. Here are some suggestions for managing as a student or school leaver:

1. **Studying with others**  
   It can be helpful to study with others to boost your motivation. Try organising online study groups with your friends or classmates where you discuss questions about assignments or share tips on studying from home, or watch vlogs for motivation.

2. **Keep an eye out for free resources and qualifications**  
   If you were hoping to start an apprenticeship or enter the job market, you might face uncertainty about your future. Organisations such as The Skills Toolkit and Future Learn offer free online courses in various subjects if you fancy learning something new.

3. **Help your teachers to help you**  
   Be honest with your teachers about how you’re feeling and how they can help you learn better from home.  
   - Suggest new resources or ways of communicating online that your teacher might not be aware of.  
   - If your teacher doesn’t get back to you, find out who your course administrator is to use as a second point of contact.  
   - Keep a record of important communications with school staff, especially when discussing coursework, dissertation or deadlines.

4. **Focus on what you can control and acknowledge what you can’t**  
   These are uncertain times, and things like exam marks, university, job or apprenticeship offers, and what the world will look like in a few months can all add to feelings of anxiety.  
   - Try a “Circle of Control” exercise, where you think about what’s stressing you out and write down the things you have no control over, the things you can influence, and the things you can control.  
   - We feel more anxious when we focus on the things we can’t control and forget about the things we can.

5. **Your productivity doesn’t determine your self-worth**  
   Life is still far from easy for a lot of us. It may not be realistic to expect yourself to be as productive as you were before. If you find yourself feeling a bit unmotivated, or you haven’t got as much done in a day as you usually would, that’s okay. Focus on making a plan that feels as manageable for you as you are.

6. **If you’re still isolated in student accommodation**  
   There is support available. Your university or the building manager of your private halls should have a procedure in place to make sure you have a way to receive food and medicines you need. Be sure to tell your tutor or student representative that you’re staying in your accommodation.
